# Good Coffee
Hosted using GitHub pages, working off the `master` branch of this repo.

To build:

  1. Open this repo locally
  2. Run `yarn start` to build the JS
  3. In a separate terminal, run `yarn sass` to build the CSS
  4. Run `yarn server` to start the Express server locally, listening on default stuff
  5. Should be able to open http://localhost:3000 and see your junk!
